## Objective

Explore the dataset and extract insights from the Medical costs dataset. Use statistical evidence to answer the following questions - 
1. Prove (or disprove) that the medical claims made by the people who smoke is greater than those who don't?
2. Prove (or disprove) with statistical evidence that the BMI of females is different from that of males.
3. Is the proportion of smokers significantly different across different regions?
4. Is the mean BMI of women with no children, one child, and two children the same?

## Dataset Overview
Introduce key aspects of the dataset relevant to health factors like smoking status, BMI, gender, region, and number of children.

## Data Cleaning
Detail the steps taken to clean the dataset, ensuring data reliability for subsequent analysis. Address any anomalies or inconsistencies to enhance the quality of the data.

## Hypothesis Testing and Data Visualization
Delve into the dataset by conducting hypothesis tests and creating visual representations to address key inquiries. This approach will illuminate trends such as demographic differences in medical costs and other significant patterns.

- Smoking and Medical Claims: Apply t-tests to examine the variance in medical claims between smokers and non-smokers. Illustrate these differences through boxplots for a clear, visual comparison.
- BMI and Gender: Utilize t-tests to assess the disparity in average BMI between males and females. Depict these differences using histograms to visually represent the distribution across genders.
- Smokers Across Regions: Implement chi-square tests to analyze the regional distribution of smokers. Showcase these regional variations through bar charts or pie charts, providing an immediate visual understanding of the data.
BMI and Number of Children in Women: Perform ANOVA to explore if women's BMI varies with the number of children they have. Present these findings via boxplots, offering a straightforward comparison across different categories.
Recommendation
Offer insights based on findings, suggest further research areas, and discuss implications for healthcare stakeholders.
